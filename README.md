# Sickle-Cell-Predictor

This is a project to reduce mortality rate among sickle cell patients. 
Sickle cell patients tend to have crisis triggered by different precipitating factors such as cold,. This project focused on early detection of four types of Crisis (Aplastic, Hemolytic, Splenic Sequestration, Vaso-occlusive crisis) and giving further advice on the response to the crisis type.

Things achieved in the project:
1. Made quantitative and qualitative research on the nature of the project.
2. Harnessed the power of beautifulsoup library in Python to gather data via web scraping.
3. Utilized a low-code open source library (PyCaret) in Python to build, optimize and save models.
4. Prepared two separate models for medical and non-medical users using Machine Learning multi-classifiers.
5. Performed a final evaluation of the models using a test dataset to confirm the metrics score.
6. Local deployment of final models using flask and ngrok.
